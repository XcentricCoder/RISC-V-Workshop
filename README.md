# RISC-V-Workshop

The “RISC-V based MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours)” workshop provides a structured introduction to RISC-V architecture, covering software-to-hardware concepts through hands-on labs. Participants begin with C programming, GCC compilation, and Spike simulation before progressing to number systems and assembly programming. The workshop delves into combinational and sequential logic, pipeline implementation, and microarchitecture of a single-cycle RISC-V CPU. Labs include instruction decoding, register file operations, ALU implementation, and control flow hazards. The final stages focus on load-store instructions, memory management, and CPU testbench development, offering comprehensive learning experience in microprocessor design and verification. This course is divided into 5 days, the summary of these days are given
